CAVA v1.2.0 README
==================

1 INTRODUCTION
--------------

CAVA (Clinical Annotation of VAriants) is a lightweight, fast, flexible and easy-to-use Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) variant annotation tool. It implements a clinical sequencing nomenclature (CSN), a fixed variant annotation consistent with the principles of the Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) guidelines, optimised for automated clinical variant annotation of NGS data. 

CAVA has been extensively tested on exome data and is being used in the Mainstreaming Cancer Genetics (MCG) programme which applies NGS to increase the availability and affordability of clinical testing of cancer predisposition genes.
